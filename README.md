# Word Guessing Game

I made Word Guessing Game at the end of the summer of 2019, right before I started my Computer Science BSc.

My main goal was to practice Java.

# Highlights
* Created a console application that can guess which word the player is thinking of based on the most frequently occurring letters in the 20000 most common English words.
* Implemented a feature that can store game statics in text files.

# Technologies Used
* Java
