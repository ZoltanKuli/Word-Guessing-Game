# The Story Behind Word Guessing Game

I made Word Guessing Game at the end of the summer of 2019, right before I started my Computer Science major.

At the time, this was an interesting little project where I mainly learned about how to handle writing and reading from text files, handling user input, and handling exceptions.

This project was also a good opportunity for me to get more comfortable with Java.
