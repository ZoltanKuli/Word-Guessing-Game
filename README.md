# The Story Behind Word Guessing Game
I wrote Word Guessing Game right before I started my Computer Science major.

At the time, this was a fun little project where I mainly learned about how to handle writing and reading from text files, handling user input, and handling exceptions.

This project was also a good opportunity for me to get more comfortable with Java.
